tirthajyoti-ghosh: [RUN_GRADLEW] ERROR: JAVA_HOME is not set and no 'java' command could be found in your PATH.

GitHub Copilot: It seems like your environment variables for Java are not set correctly. You need to set `JAVA_HOME` to the path where your JDK is installed and also add the JDK's `bin` directory to your `PATH`.

Here's how you can do it:

1. First, find out where Java is installed. You can do this by using the `update-alternatives` command:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config java
```

This will display a list of installed Java versions and their paths. Copy the path for the version you want to use.

2. Open your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file (located in your home directory) for editing:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

3. Add these lines at the end of the file, replacing `/path/to/your/jdk` with the path you copied earlier:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

4. Save the file and exit the editor.

5. Reload your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now, your `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` variables should be set correctly. Try running your Gradle command again.

tirthajyoti-ghosh: java is not installed

GitHub Copilot: If Java is not installed on your Linux machine, you can install it by following these steps:

1. Update the package repository:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

2. Install the Java Development Kit (JDK). You can install the default JDK and JRE in Ubuntu by typing:

```bash
sudo apt install default-jdk
```

This will install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and the Java Development Kit (JDK), which includes the JRE.

3. Verify the installation by checking the Java version:

```bash
java -version
```

This should display the installed version of Java.

4. If you need to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable (some applications require this), find the installation path:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config java
```

This command will show the path of the Java installation.

5. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. Open `/etc/environment` in any text editor like nano or vim and add the following line at the end:

```bash
JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64"
```

Replace `/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64` with the path of your Java installation.

6. Reload the system-wide environment variables:

```bash
source /etc/environment
```

7. Verify that `JAVA_HOME` is set correctly:

```bash
echo $JAVA_HOME
```

This should display the path to your Java installation.

GitHub Copilot: The error message indicates that the Android SDK location is not found. You need to set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to the path where your Android SDK is installed.

Here's how you can do it:

1. First, find out where Android SDK is installed. If you've installed Android Studio, the default location is usually at `~/Android/Sdk`. If you can't find it, you can check it from Android Studio: `File -> Project Structure -> SDK Location`.

2. Open your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file (located in your home directory) for editing:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

3. Add these lines at the end of the file, replacing `/path/to/your/android/sdk` with the path you found in step 1:

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/your/android/sdk
export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$PATH
export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$PATH
```

4. Save the file and exit the editor.

5. Reload your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` to apply the changes:

```bash

Now, your `ANDROID_HOME` variable should be set correctly. Try running your Gradle command again.

If the problem persists, you can also define the SDK location in your project's `local.properties` file. Open the `local.properties` file in your Android project and add this line:

```properties
sdk.dir=/path/to/your/android/sdk
```

Replace `/path/to/your/android/sdk` with the path to your Android SDK. Save the file and try running your Gradle command again.

tirthajyoti-ghosh: i don't have android sdk installed

GitHub Copilot: If you don't have the Android SDK installed, you can install it by following these steps:

1. First, install Android Studio as it comes with the Android SDK. You can download it from the official Android website: https://developer.android.com/studio

2. Once downloaded, extract the zip file and navigate to the `android-studio/bin/` directory. Run the `studio.sh` file to start the Android Studio setup wizard:

```bash
cd android-studio/bin/
./studio.sh
```

3. Follow the setup wizard to install Android Studio along with the Android SDK. The wizard will guide you through the installation process.

4. After installation, you can find the Android SDK location in Android Studio under `File -> Project Structure -> SDK Location`.

5. Set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to the path where your Android SDK is installed. Open your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file for editing:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

6. Add these lines at the end of the file, replacing `/path/to/your/android/sdk` with the path you found in step 4:

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/your/android/sdk
export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$PATH
export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$PATH
```

7. Save the file and exit the editor.

8. Reload your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now, your `ANDROID_HOME` variable should be set correctly. Try running your Gradle command again.

tirthajyoti-ghosh: i am using wsl

GitHub Copilot: If you're using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can still install the Android SDK by following these steps:

1. First, update your package repository:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

2. Install the required packages:

```bash
sudo apt install unzip wget
```

3. Download the Android SDK command line tools:

```bash
wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/commandlinetools-linux-7302050_latest.zip
```

4. Unzip the downloaded file:

```bash
unzip commandlinetools-linux-7302050_latest.zip -d ~/android-sdk
```

5. Set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to the path where your Android SDK is installed. Open your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file for editing:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

6. Add these lines at the end of the file:

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=~/android-sdk
export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/bin:$PATH
export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$PATH
```

7. Save the file and exit the editor.

8. Reload your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

9. Accept the Android SDK licenses:

```bash
yes | sdkmanager --licenses
```

Now, your `ANDROID_HOME` variable should be set correctly. Try running your Gradle command again.

tirthajyoti-ghosh: tirtha@TIRTHA:~$ yes | sdkmanager --licenses
Error: Could not determine SDK root.
Error: Either specify it explicitly with --sdk_root= or move this package into its expected location: <sdk>/cmdline-tools/latest/

GitHub Copilot:

tirthajyoti-ghosh: tirtha@TIRTHA:~$ yes | sdkmanager --licenses
Error: Could not determine SDK root.
Error: Either specify it explicitly with --sdk_root= or move this package into its expected location: <sdk>/cmdline-tools/latest/

GitHub Copilot: The error message indicates that the `sdkmanager` cannot determine the SDK root. This is likely because the Android SDK command line tools were not installed in the correct directory structure.

Here's how you can fix it:

1. Create a new directory named `cmdline-tools` within the `android-sdk` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools
```

2. Move the contents of the `android-sdk` directory into the new `cmdline-tools` directory:

```bash
mv ~/android-sdk/* ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/
```

3. Now, try accepting the Android SDK licenses again:

```bash
yes | ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/bin/sdkmanager --licenses
```

This should resolve the issue. If you still encounter problems, ensure that the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is correctly set to `~/android-sdk` and that this directory contains a `cmdline-tools` directory.

tirthajyoti-ghosh: tirtha@TIRTHA:~$ mv ~/android-sdk/\* ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/
mv: cannot move '/home/tirtha/android-sdk/cmdline-tools' to a subdirectory of itself, '/home/tirtha/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/cmdline-tools'

GitHub Copilot: Apologies for the confusion. The error is due to the command trying to move the `cmdline-tools` directory into itself. Instead, you should create a `cmdline-tools` directory and then move the downloaded tools into a new directory named `latest` within `cmdline-tools`. Here's how to do it:

1. Remove the existing `cmdline-tools` directory:

```bash
rm -rf ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools
```

2. Create a new `cmdline-tools` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest
```

3. Move the downloaded command line tools into the `latest` directory:

```bash
mv ~/android-sdk/* ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/
```

4. Now, try accepting the Android SDK licenses again:

```bash
yes | ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager --licenses
```

This should resolve the issue. If you still encounter problems, ensure that the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is correctly set to `~/android-sdk` and that this directory contains a `cmdline-tools/latest` directory.

tirthajyoti-ghosh: tirtha@TIRTHA:~$ mv ~/android-sdk/\* ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/
mv: cannot move '/home/tirtha/android-sdk/cmdline-tools' to a subdirectory of itself, '/home/tirtha/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/cmdline-tools'

GitHub Copilot: I apologize for the confusion. The error is due to the command trying to move the `cmdline-tools` directory into itself. The correct steps to move the downloaded tools into the `cmdline-tools/latest` directory are as follows:

1. Remove the existing `cmdline-tools` directory:

```bash
rm -rf ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools
```

2. Recreate the `cmdline-tools` directory and a `latest` subdirectory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest
```

3. Move the downloaded command line tools into the `latest` directory:

```bash
mv ~/android-sdk/tools ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/
```

4. Now, try accepting the Android SDK licenses again:

```bash
yes | ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager --licenses
```

This should resolve the issue. If you still encounter problems, ensure that the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is correctly set to `~/android-sdk` and that this directory contains a `cmdline-tools/latest` directory.

tirthajyoti-ghosh: tirtha@TIRTHA:~$ mv ~/android-sdk/tools ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/
mv: cannot stat '/home/tirtha/android-sdk/tools': No such file or directory

GitHub Copilot: I apologize for the confusion. It seems there was a misunderstanding in the previous steps. Let's correct this.

The `commandlinetools-linux-7302050_latest.zip` should be extracted to a directory named `latest` inside `cmdline-tools` in the `android-sdk` directory. Here are the correct steps:

1. Remove the existing `android-sdk` directory:

```bash
rm -rf ~/android-sdk
```

2. Create the correct directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest
```

3. Download the Android SDK command line tools:

```bash
wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/commandlinetools-linux-7302050_latest.zip
```

4. Unzip the downloaded file to the `latest` directory:

```bash
unzip commandlinetools-linux-7302050_latest.zip -d ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest
```

5. Now, try accepting the Android SDK licenses again:

```bash
yes | ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager --licenses
```

This should resolve the issue. If you still encounter problems, ensure that the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is correctly set to `~/android-sdk` and that this directory contains a `cmdline-tools/latest` directory.

tirthajyoti-ghosh: irtha@TIRTHA:~$ yes | ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager --licenses
-bash: /home/tirtha/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager: No such file or directory

GitHub Copilot: I apologize for the confusion. It seems there was a misunderstanding in the previous steps. The `commandlinetools-linux-7302050_latest.zip` should be extracted directly into the `cmdline-tools` directory, not into a `latest` subdirectory. Here are the correct steps:

1. Remove the existing `android-sdk` directory:

```bash
rm -rf ~/android-sdk
```

2. Create the correct directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools
```

3. Download the Android SDK command line tools:

```bash
wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/commandlinetools-linux-7302050_latest.zip
```

4. Unzip the downloaded file to the `cmdline-tools` directory:

```bash
unzip commandlinetools-linux-7302050_latest.zip -d ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools
```

5. Now, try accepting the Android SDK licenses again:

```bash
yes | ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/bin/sdkmanager --licenses
```

This should resolve the issue. If you still encounter problems, ensure that the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is correctly set to `~/android-sdk` and that this directory contains a `cmdline-tools` directory.

tirthajyoti-ghosh: tirtha@TIRTHA:~$ yes | ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/bin/sdkmanager --licenses
-bash: /home/tirtha/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/bin/sdkmanager: No such file or directory

GitHub Copilot: I apologize for the confusion earlier. It seems the Android SDK command line tools were not properly extracted. Let's try again with a slightly different approach:

1. Remove the existing `android-sdk` directory:

```bash
rm -rf ~/android-sdk
```

2. Create the correct directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools
```

3. Download the Android SDK command line tools:

```bash
wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/commandlinetools-linux-7302050_latest.zip
```

4. Unzip the downloaded file to the `cmdline-tools` directory:

```bash
unzip commandlinetools-linux-7302050_latest.zip -d ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools
```

5. Move the unzipped `cmdline-tools` directory to a new directory named `latest` within the `cmdline-tools` directory:

```bash
mv ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/cmdline-tools ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest
```

6. Now, try accepting the Android SDK licenses again:

```bash
yes | ~/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager --licenses
```

This should resolve the issue. If you still encounter problems, ensure that the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is correctly set to `~/android-sdk` and that this directory contains a `cmdline-tools/latest` directory.

tirthajyoti-ghosh: [RUN_GRADLEW] FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
[RUN_GRADLEW] * What went wrong:
[RUN_GRADLEW] Gradle build daemon disappeared unexpectedly (it may have been killed or may have crashed)

GitHub Copilot: The error message "Gradle build daemon disappeared unexpectedly" usually indicates that the Gradle daemon, which runs in the background to execute build-related tasks, has crashed or been killed. This can happen due to various reasons such as insufficient memory, system instability, or a bug in Gradle.

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Increase the Java heap size for Gradle**: Gradle runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and uses a portion of your computer's total memory. If Gradle doesn't have enough memory, it can crash. You can increase the maximum amount of memory that Gradle can use by adding the following line to your `gradle.properties` file:

```properties
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2048m
````

This line sets the maximum Java heap size to 2048 MB. You can adjust this value based on your system's available memory.

2. **Upgrade Gradle**: If you're using an older version of Gradle, upgrading to the latest version might solve the problem. You can upgrade Gradle by changing the version number in your `gradle-wrapper.properties` file.

3. **Clean the project**: Sometimes, cleaning the project can help resolve issues. You can clean your project by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./gradlew clean
```

4. **Disable the Gradle daemon**: If none of the above solutions work, you can try disabling the Gradle daemon. To do this, add the following line to your `gradle.properties` file:

```properties
org.gradle.daemon=false
```

This will make Gradle run in the foreground and could help avoid the issue. However, keep in mind that this will also make your builds slower, as Gradle won't be able to keep build information in memory between builds.

tirthajyoti-ghosh: i am trying to create the android build localy with eas

GitHub Copilot: To create an Android build locally with Expo Application Services (EAS), you need to follow these steps:

1. **Install EAS CLI**: If you haven't installed EAS CLI, you can do so by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

2. **Configure eas.json**: You need to have an `eas.json` file in your project root with at least the following content:

```json
{
    "build": {
        "release": {
            "distribution": "store"
        }
    }
}
```

3. **Run the build**: You can now run the build command:

```bash
eas build --platform android
```

This will create a new build and you will get a URL where you can check the status of the build and download the APK once it's ready.

Please note that you need to have a valid `google-services.json` file in your project for Firebase services. The file you posted seems to be correct. Make sure it's located in the `android/app/` directory of your project.

Also, remember to commit all your changes before running the build, as EAS Build only considers committed changes.

If you encounter any issues, please provide the error messages for further assistance.

tirthajyoti-ghosh: there is no android folder or gradlew folder

GitHub Copilot: If you're working with an Expo project and you don't see the `android` directory, it's likely because you haven't ejected the project yet. The `android` and `ios` directories are not present in a managed Expo project. They are only created when you eject the project to have bare workflow which gives you more control over the native code.

If you want to continue with the managed workflow (without ejecting), you can build your app using `expo build:android` instead of `eas build --platform android --local`.

However, if you need to eject your project, you can do so by running `expo eject`. This will create `android` and `ios` directories in your project. After ejecting, you'll be able to see the `gradlew` file in the `android` directory.

Please note that ejecting is a permanent action. Once you've ejected your project, you can't go back to the managed workflow. Before ejecting, make sure that's what you really need for your project.

tirthajyoti-ghosh: expo build:android has been discontinued (January 4, 2023).

GitHub Copilot: I see, Expo has discontinued the `expo build:android` command and moved to EAS Build.

If you don't have an `android` directory in your project, it means you're still in the managed workflow of Expo. In this case, you should be able to build your project with EAS Build without needing to eject.

Here are the steps to do it:

1. **Install EAS CLI**: If you haven't installed EAS CLI, you can do so by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

2. **Configure eas.json**: You need to have an `eas.json` file in your project root with at least the following content:

```json
{
    "build": {
        "release": {
            "distribution": "store"
        }
    }
}
```

3. **Run the build**: You can now run the build command:

```bash
eas build --platform android
```

This will create a new build and you will get a URL where you can check the status of the build and download the APK once it's ready.

Please note that you need to have a valid `google-services.json` file in your project for Firebase services. The file you posted seems to be correct. Make sure it's located in the root directory of your project.

Also, remember to commit all your changes before running the build, as EAS Build only considers committed changes.

If you encounter any issues, please provide the error messages for further assistance.

tirthajyoti-ghosh: yeah i did that. that's where i got this error:
[RUN_GRADLEW] FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
[RUN_GRADLEW] \* What went wrong:
[RUN_GRADLEW] Gradle build daemon disappeared unexpectedly (it may have been killed or may have crashed)

GitHub Copilot: I see, you're encountering the Gradle daemon error while using EAS Build. This is unusual because EAS Build runs on Expo's servers, not on your local machine, so it shouldn't be affected by your local Gradle setup.

However, EAS Build does support local builds with the `--local` flag, which would use your local Gradle setup. If you're using this flag, you might encounter issues with your local Gradle setup.

If you're not using the `--local` flag, this might be an issue on Expo's servers. In this case, I would recommend reaching out to Expo support or checking their forums for help.

If you're using the `--local` flag and want to troubleshoot this issue, you could try the following:

1. **Check your system's resources**: Make sure your system has enough resources (CPU, memory) available. Gradle can be resource-intensive, and if your system is under heavy load, it might kill the Gradle daemon to free up resources.

2. **Update your system**: Make sure your system and all its packages are up to date. An outdated system or package could cause instability issues.

3. **Reinstall Gradle**: If none of the above work, you could try reinstalling Gradle. This would ensure you have a clean, up-to-date installation.

If none of these solutions work, please provide more details about your setup (e.g., operating system, Gradle version, etc.) for further assistance.

tirthajyoti-ghosh: remember the readme file i told you to create? give me that again. i lost it

GitHub Copilot: I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to remember past interactions or files that were created in previous sessions. However, I can help you create a new README file. Here's a basic template for a README file:
